Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9+\n2. Activate the virtual environment\n3. Install PyCaret with specific compatible versions\n\n**For Google Colab**: Skip this cell (Colab manages its own environment)\n\n### Instructions\n\n**Option 1: Using venv (recommended)**\n```bash\n# Navigate to your project directory\ncd /Users/banbalagan/Projects/pycaret-automl-examples\n\n# Create virtual environment\npython3.9 -m venv venv\n\n# Activate virtual environment\n# On macOS/Linux:\nsource venv/bin/activate\n# On Windows:\n# venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Verify Python version\npython --version\n\n# Continue to next cell for package installation\n```\n\n**Option 2: Using conda**\n```bash\n# Create conda environment\nconda create -n pycaret-env python=3.9 -y\n\n# Activate environment\nconda activate pycaret-env\n```\n\n### Expected Output\nAfter activation, your terminal prompt should show `(venv)` or `(pycaret-env)` prefix, indicating the virtual environment is active.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Run this in your terminal BEFORE opening Jupyter Notebook\n- After creating/activating the virtual environment, install Jupyter in it:\n  ```bash\n  pip install jupyter notebook\n  ```\n- Then launch Jupyter from within the activated environment:\n  ```bash\n  jupyter notebook\n  ```\n- Select the kernel that corresponds to your virtual environment in Jupyter",

For local environments, we install specific package versions to ensure stability and reproducibility.\n\n### Technical Details\n- **Google Colab**: Install compatible versions to avoid runtime crashes\n- **Local Environment**: Install PyCaret with specific versions (Option 2 - recommended)\n- Import all necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning\n\n### Expected Output\n- **Google Colab**: Installation messages and a reminder to restart the runtime\n- **Local Environment**: Clean installation of all required packages\n\n### IMPORTANT (Google Colab Users)\n⚠️ After running this cell in Colab, you MUST restart the runtime:\n- Click: **Runtime → Restart runtime** (or Ctrl+M .)\n- After restart, skip this cell and run all other cells normally"

    "### Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Current Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Only spending data (no demographics, geography details)\n",
    "   - Single time snapshot (no temporal patterns)\n",
    "   - Assumes stable segments over time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Important Notes**:\n",
    "   - Segments may overlap (fuzzy boundaries)\n",
    "   - Customers can move between segments\n",
    "   - Regular re-clustering needed\n",
    "   - Business context essential for naming\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Future Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Add temporal data (seasonality, trends)\n",
    "   - Include customer demographics\n",
    "   - Geographic segmentation\n",
    "   - Predictive segment migration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Clustering**:\n",
    "- No predefined categories\n",
    "- Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- Discovering hidden patterns\n",
    "- Customer segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Classification**:\n",
    "- Have labeled data\n",
    "- Predicting known outcomes\n",
    "- Clear target variable\n",
    "- Disease diagnosis, fraud detection\n",

    "**Main Insight**: Different customer types exist with distinct purchasing patterns - restaurants vs retail vs specialized customers.\n",

    "- Experiment with different K values\n",
