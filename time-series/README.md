# Time Series Forecasting - Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates time series forecasting using PyCaret to predict future energy consumption patterns, enabling utilities and building managers to optimize power generation, load balancing, and cost management.

## Problem Statement

Forecast hourly energy consumption (kWh) for the next 24-168 hours using historical consumption patterns, enabling proactive grid management, demand response, and energy planning.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Synthetic hourly energy consumption data (realistic patterns)
- **Rows**: 8,760 hours (1 year of data)
- **Frequency**: Hourly measurements
- **Target**: Energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
- **Patterns**: Seasonality, trends, weekly cycles, special events

### Time Series Components

| Component | Description | Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Trend** | Long-term direction | Gradual increase over year |
| **Seasonality** | Regular patterns | Daily cycles (peak 6-9 PM), weekly patterns (weekday vs weekend) |
| **Noise** | Random variation | Weather variations, unexpected events |
| **Special Events** | One-time occurrences | Holidays, extreme weather |

### Features

## Key Insights

### Time Series vs. Traditional ML

| Aspect | Traditional ML | Time Series |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Data Split** | Random shuffle | Temporal (train < test in time) |
| **Independence** | Assumes i.i.d. | Temporal autocorrelation |
| **Features** | Static | Lags, rolling stats, time features |
| **Validation** | K-fold cross-validation | Time series cross-validation |
| **Leakage Risk** | Feature leakage | Future information leakage |

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **NEVER shuffle time series data** - Violates temporal ordering
2. **NEVER use future information** in training (data leakage)
3. **NEVER use standard k-fold CV** - Use time series CV instead
4. **NEVER ignore seasonality** - Leads to poor forecasts
5. **NEVER skip baseline** - Simple models often competitive

### Forecasting Approaches Comparison

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Naive** | Simple, fast, interpretable | Poor for complex patterns | Baseline comparison |
| **ARIMA** | Classical, well-understood, handles trends/seasonality | Linear assumptions, manual tuning | Univariate, stationary series |
| **Random Forest** | Handles non-linearity, feature importance, robust | Needs feature engineering, less interpretable | Multi-variate with exogenous variables |
| **Deep Learning** (LSTM/GRU) | Captures complex patterns, automatic feature learning | Needs large data, computationally expensive | Large datasets, complex patterns |

## Feature Engineering for Time Series

1. **Lag Features**: energy_lag_1h, energy_lag_24h, energy_lag_168h (previous values)
2. **Rolling Statistics**: rolling_mean_24h, rolling_std_24h (moving averages)
3. **Cyclical Encoding**: sin/cos transformations for hour, day_of_week, month
4. **Calendar Features**: hour, day_of_week, month, is_weekend
5. **Exogenous Variables**: temperature, weather conditions

## Deployment Applications

1. **Real-Time Forecasting Dashboard**: Update predictions every hour

## Performance Metrics

### Evaluation Metrics for Time Series

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Average forecast error in kWh
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Scale-independent metric (5-10% is good)
- **R²**: Variance explained (0.8-0.95 typical for energy forecasting)

### Forecast Horizons

- **Short-term** (1-24 hours): Operational decisions, load balancing
- **Medium-term** (1-7 days): Maintenance scheduling, fuel procurement
- **Long-term** (weeks-months): Capacity planning, infrastructure investment

## Advanced Techniques (Not Covered)

For production systems, consider:

1. **Prophet** (Facebook): Automatic seasonality detection, handles holidays
2. **LSTM/GRU**: Deep learning for complex non-linear patterns
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine statistical + ML models

## Time to Complete

Approximately 40-50 minutes

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Data Quality**: Missing values, outliers severely impact forecasts
2. **Concept Drift**: Patterns change over time (COVID-19, climate change)
3. **Exogenous Variables**: Weather forecasts also have uncertainty
4. **Black Swan Events**: Models can't predict unprecedented events
5. **Computational Cost**: Real-time forecasting requires efficient models
6. **Forecast Horizon**: Accuracy degrades for longer horizons

## Model Retraining Strategy

- **Frequency**: Retrain weekly/monthly as new data arrives
- **Sliding Window**: Use last 1-2 years of data (avoid very old patterns)
- **Monitoring**: Track MAE/MAPE on recent forecasts, trigger retraining if degradation
- **A/B Testing**: Compare new model vs. current production model before deployment
