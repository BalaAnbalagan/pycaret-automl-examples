## Video 1: Binary Classification - Heart Disease Prediction
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Notebook**: `binary-classification/heart_disease_classification.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
Hi, I'm Bala Anbalagan, and in this video I'll walk you through a binary
classification project for heart disease prediction using PyCaret.

This project demonstrates supervised machine learning for medical diagnosis -
one of the most critical applications of AI in healthcare.
```

**[0:30-1:30] Problem Statement & Dataset**
```
The problem: Can we predict heart disease presence based on clinical measurements?

I'm using the UCI Heart Disease dataset with 303 patients and 13 features including:
- Age, sex, chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Maximum heart rate
- ST depression (ECG measurement)

[Screen: Show df.head() and df.info()]

This is a classic binary classification problem - the target is 0 (no disease)
or 1 (disease present).
```

**[1:30-2:30] Model Selection with PyCaret**
```
Here's where PyCaret shines - with just a few lines of code, I can:

1. Setup the experiment with proper train-test split and preprocessing
   [Screen: Show setup() output]

2. Compare 15+ classification algorithms automatically
   [Screen: Show compare_models() results]

Look at this - Logistic Regression came out on top with:
- Accuracy: 85-87%
- AUC-ROC: 0.90-0.92
- F1 Score: 0.85

Why Logistic Regression? In healthcare, we need interpretability.
Doctors need to understand WHY the model made a prediction.
```

**[2:30-3:30] Model Evaluation**
```
Let's look at the evaluation metrics:

[Screen: Show confusion matrix]
The confusion matrix shows:
- True Positives: 45 patients correctly identified with disease
- True Negatives: 42 correctly identified as healthy
- False Positives: 8 false alarms
- False Negatives: 5 missed cases

In medical diagnosis, False Negatives are most critical - we don't want to
miss actual cases of heart disease. That's why I focus on RECALL metric.

[Screen: Show ROC curve]
The AUC of 0.91 means the model has excellent discrimination ability.
```

**[3:30-4:30] Feature Importance**
```
[Screen: Show feature importance plot]

The most important predictors are:
1. Chest pain type (cp) - Different types indicate different risks
2. ST depression (oldpeak) - ECG measurement
3. Maximum heart rate (thalach)
4. Number of major vessels (ca)

These align with medical knowledge, which validates our model.
```

**[4:30-5:00] Production Considerations & Conclusion**
```
For production deployment:
- Need FDA approval for medical devices
- Continuous monitoring for model drift
- Integration with Electronic Health Records
- Regular retraining with new data

This project demonstrates:
✓ Proper ML workflow for healthcare
✓ Model comparison and selection
✓ Interpretability for clinical use
✓ Production-ready implementation

## Video 2: Multiclass Classification - Dry Bean Classification
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes
**Notebook**: `multiclass-classification/dry_bean_classification.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
Welcome back! In this video, I'm tackling a multiclass classification problem -
classifying 7 different types of dry beans based on their physical characteristics.

This is a computer vision problem solved using traditional ML on extracted features.
```

**[0:30-1:30] Dataset & Problem**
```
[Screen: Show sample images of beans]

The dataset contains 13,611 bean samples across 7 classes:
- Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Horoz, Sira, Dermason

[Screen: Show feature list]
16 morphological features extracted from images:
- Area, Perimeter, Major/Minor Axis Length
- Aspect Ratio, Eccentricity, Convex Area
- Extent, Solidity, Roundness, Compactness, ShapeFactor

This is more challenging than binary classification because the model must
distinguish between 7 similar-looking classes.
```

**[1:30-2:30] Model Comparison**
```
[Screen: Show compare_models() results]

PyCaret tested 15+ algorithms. The winners:
1. Random Forest: 92-94% accuracy
2. Extra Trees: Similar performance
3. XGBoost: 91-93% accuracy

Why do tree-based models excel here?
- They capture complex decision boundaries
- Handle non-linear relationships between features
- Robust to feature scale differences
- No need for feature normalization

The ensemble approach means we're combining hundreds of decision trees.
```

**[2:30-3:30] Detailed Performance Analysis**
```
[Screen: Show confusion matrix heatmap]

Look at this confusion matrix - the diagonal shows correct predictions.
Most classes have 95%+ precision, but notice:
- Some confusion between Horoz and Dermason (similar shapes)
- Bombay is perfectly separated (very distinct features)

[Screen: Show classification report]
Per-class F1 scores range from 88% to 97% - excellent across all types.

This balanced performance is critical for real-world deployment.
```

**[3:30-4:30] Feature Importance & Business Value**
```
[Screen: Show feature importance]

Top predictive features:
1. AspectRation (shape ratio) - 25%
2. Area (bean size) - 18%
3. Perimeter - 15%

This tells us SHAPE matters most for bean classification.

Real-world applications:
- Agricultural quality control
- Automated sorting systems
- Reducing manual inspection costs
- Ensuring variety purity for farmers
```

**[4:30-5:00] Conclusion**
```
Key takeaways:
✓ Multiclass classification with high accuracy
✓ Ensemble methods for complex boundaries
✓ Feature engineering from images
✓ Production-ready for automated sorting

This demonstrates ML in agriculture and industrial automation.
Thanks for watching!

## Video 3: Regression - Insurance Cost Prediction
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes
**Notebook**: `regression/insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
In this video, I'm solving a regression problem - predicting medical insurance
costs based on personal and health factors.

Unlike classification which predicts categories, regression predicts continuous
numerical values - in this case, dollar amounts.
```

**[0:30-1:30] Problem & Dataset**
```
[Screen: Show target distribution histogram]

The challenge: Predict insurance charges for 1,338 individuals.

Features available:
- Age: 18 to 64 years
- Sex: Male/Female
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- Children: Number of dependents
- Smoker: Yes/No
- Region: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest

[Screen: Show charges distribution]
Charges range from $1,121 to $63,770 with a mean of $13,270.
Notice the right-skewed distribution - some very high values.
```

**[1:30-2:30] Model Selection**
```
[Screen: Show compare_models() results]

PyCaret compared regression algorithms:
1. Gradient Boosting: R² = 0.86, RMSE = $4,600
2. Extra Trees: R² = 0.85
3. Random Forest: R² = 0.84

Why Gradient Boosting won?
- Captures non-linear relationships (e.g., smoking impact)
- Sequential learning corrects previous errors
- Handles interactions between features automatically

R² of 0.86 means the model explains 86% of variance in insurance costs.
RMSE of $4,600 is our average prediction error.
```

**[2:30-3:30] Key Insights from Analysis**
```
[Screen: Show feature importance]

Most impactful factors:
1. Smoker status - DOMINATES! (50%+ importance)
   - Smokers pay 3-4x more on average

2. Age - Linear increase with age
   - Every 10 years adds ~$3,000-4,000

3. BMI - Non-linear effect
   - Obesity (BMI > 30) significantly increases costs

4. Children, Sex, Region - Minor impact

[Screen: Show residual plot]
The residual plot shows our predictions are unbiased - errors distributed evenly.
```

**[3:30-4:30] Prediction Examples & Validation**
```
[Screen: Show prediction examples]

Let's test some scenarios:

Scenario 1: 25-year-old non-smoker, BMI 22
- Predicted: $2,800
- Actual: $2,721
- Error: 2.9% ✓

Scenario 2: 45-year-old smoker, BMI 32
- Predicted: $38,500
- Actual: $39,611
- Error: 2.8% ✓

The model handles both low and high-cost cases accurately.
```

**[4:30-5:00] Business Applications & Conclusion**
```
Real-world applications:
- Insurance premium calculation
- Risk assessment for underwriting
- Identifying high-risk individuals for intervention
- Policy pricing optimization

Production considerations:
- Regular retraining as healthcare costs change
- Fairness auditing (avoid discrimination)

## Video 4: Clustering - Wholesale Customer Segmentation
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes
**Notebook**: `clustering/wholesale_customer_segmentation.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
This video covers unsupervised learning - clustering for customer segmentation.

Unlike previous videos where we had labels, here we're discovering hidden patterns
in unlabeled data. No target variable - the algorithm finds groups naturally.
```

**[0:30-1:30] Business Problem & Dataset**
```
The challenge: A wholesale distributor wants to understand their customer base.

[Screen: Show dataset]
440 customers with annual spending across 6 categories:
- Fresh products (fruits, vegetables)
- Milk products
- Grocery items
- Frozen goods
- Detergents & paper
- Delicatessen

[Screen: Show correlation heatmap]
Notice: Fresh and Grocery are negatively correlated - customers buy one OR the other,
rarely both in high volumes. This suggests natural groupings.
```

**[1:30-2:30] Finding Optimal Clusters**
```
[Screen: Show elbow method plot]

How many clusters? We use the elbow method:
- Plot distortion vs number of clusters
- Look for the "elbow" where improvement slows

The elbow at k=4 suggests 4 distinct customer segments.

[Screen: Show silhouette score plot]
Silhouette score of 0.48 confirms 4 is optimal - good separation between clusters.

We tested K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN - K-Means performed best.
```

**[2:30-3:30] Cluster Profiles - The "Aha!" Moment**
```
[Screen: Show cluster visualization 2D PCA]

Here's what we discovered - 4 distinct customer types:

**Cluster 1: Fresh-Focused Retailers** (32% of customers)
- High: Fresh products (avg $10K)
- Low: Grocery, Detergents
- Who: Fresh produce markets, fruit stands

**Cluster 2: Grocery-Focused Retailers** (28%)
- High: Grocery ($8K), Detergents ($5K)
- Low: Fresh products
- Who: Convenience stores, supermarkets

**Cluster 3: Balanced Mid-Volume** (25%)
- Medium spending across all categories
- Who: Small general stores

**Cluster 4: High-Volume Mixed** (15%)
- High spending across ALL categories
- Who: Hotels, restaurants, large retailers
```

**[3:30-4:30] Business Actionability**
```
[Screen: Show cluster comparison table]

Now the distributor can:

1. **Personalized Marketing**
   - Fresh-Focused: Promote seasonal fruits, organic options
   - Grocery-Focused: Bulk discounts on dry goods

2. **Inventory Optimization**
   - Stock fresh products near Cluster 1 customers
   - Warehouse grocery items for Cluster 2

3. **Sales Strategy**
   - Cluster 4 (high-value) gets premium service
   - Cross-sell opportunities: Offer frozen to fresh customers

4. **Pricing**
   - Volume discounts for Cluster 4
   - Bundle deals tailored to each cluster

This turns data into a $$ revenue opportunity!
```

**[4:30-5:00] Conclusion**
```
Key learnings:
✓ Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns
✓ K-Means for customer segmentation
✓ Elbow method and silhouette for validation
✓ Cluster profiling drives business strategy

This demonstrates ML for business intelligence and marketing.

Real-world impact: Increased retention, higher CLV, optimized operations.

Thanks for watching!

## Video 5: Anomaly Detection - Network Intrusion Detection
**Duration**: 5-6 minutes (This is your showcase piece!)
**Notebook**: `anomaly-detection/network_intrusion_detection.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:40] Introduction - Set the Stakes**
```
Welcome to my most advanced project - Network Intrusion Detection using real
cybersecurity data from the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset!

This isn't synthetic data - I'm working with ACTUAL network traffic captures from
a real university research testbed including multiple attack types:
DoS attacks, PortScans, Brute Force, Botnets, and Web exploits.

This is production-grade cybersecurity ML that enterprises use to protect networks.
```

**[0:40-1:40] The Cybersecurity Challenge**
```
The problem: Detect malicious network traffic in real-time without knowing what
the attack looks like beforehand.

Traditional signature-based detection FAILS against:
- Zero-day attacks (never seen before)
- Polymorphic malware (changes signature every time)
- Advanced Persistent Threats (low and slow)

This is where Machine Learning excels - detecting ANOMALOUS patterns instead of
matching known signatures.

[Screen: Show dataset loading cell with traffic composition]
```

**[1:40-2:40] The Dataset - Diverse Attack Traffic**
```
[Screen: Show dataset information output]

CIC-IDS-2017 from University of New Brunswick:
Nearly 5,000 network flows with 7 different traffic types:

Normal Traffic: 81.2% (4,000 flows)
Attack Types: 18.8% (924 flows)
  - DoS GoldenEye: 6.1% (300 flows)
  - PortScan: 5.1% (250 flows) - Reconnaissance
  - FTP Brute Force: 4.1% (200 flows) - Password attacks
  - Botnet: 2.0% (100 flows) - Compromised hosts
  - Web attacks (XSS + SQL Injection): 1.5% (74 flows)

Each flow has 115 features - packet counts, byte rates, timing patterns,
TCP flags - everything a firewall sees.

This realistic 80/20 split mirrors real networks where attacks are the minority.
```

**[2:40-3:40] Model Comparison - Finding the Best Algorithm**
```
[Screen: Scroll to "Comparing All Anomaly Detection Models"]

Since PyCaret doesn't have compare_models for anomaly detection, I manually
evaluated three algorithms:

[Screen: Show comparison table]

Results:
1. LOF (Local Outlier Factor): F1 = 0.183 - WINNER!
2. Isolation Forest: F1 = 0.071
3. One-Class SVM: F1 = 0.054

LOF won because it adapts to varying density regions - perfect for diverse
attack types. It compares each flow's local density to its neighbors.

All three flagged around 493 flows as anomalies (10% of dataset), but LOF
had the best balance of precision and recall.

[Screen: Scroll to t-SNE visualization]

This t-SNE plot shows how the model separates anomalies (red/yellow) from
normal traffic (blue) in 2D space.
```

**[3:40-4:40] Detection Results & Cybersecurity Reality**
```
[Screen: Show confusion matrix]

Using Isolation Forest on 4,924 flows:
- Flagged 493 as suspicious (10%)
- True attacks in dataset: 924 (18.8%)

The confusion matrix shows:
- True Positives: Caught attacks ✓
- False Positives: Normal traffic flagged (alert fatigue)
- False Negatives: Missed attacks ⚠️ (MOST CRITICAL!)

[Screen: Show top anomalies table]

Interestingly, the top 10 highest-scoring flows were mostly BENIGN traffic
with unusual characteristics - high packet counts or long durations.

This is the challenge: anomaly detection flags "unusual," not necessarily
"malicious." Real deployments need human analysts to investigate.
```

**[4:40-5:30] Attack Patterns & What Models Detect**
```
[Screen: Show characteristics comparison table]

What makes traffic anomalous? Comparing flagged vs normal flows:

Key differences:
- Duration: 224% longer
- Packet count: 2,485% higher (25x more packets!)
- Payload bytes: 9,226% higher (92x more data!)
- Forward packets: 2,180% higher
- Backward packets: 2,802% higher

These massive differences show DoS attacks and bulk transfers being flagged.

The model learned that normal traffic is:
- Short duration
- Few packets
- Small payloads
- Balanced bidirectional flow

Attacks violate these patterns - floods of packets, huge payloads, or
asymmetric traffic.
```

**[5:30-6:00] Production Deployment & Wrap-Up**
```
[Screen: Show deployment architecture from notebook]

Real-world deployment:
Network → Feature Extraction → ML Model → Anomaly Scores → SIEM → Analysts

This project showcases:
✓ Real cybersecurity dataset (CIC-IDS-2017)
✓ Diverse attack types (7 different threat categories)
✓ Model comparison (tested 3 algorithms)
✓ 115 features - production-scale feature engineering
✓ Unsupervised learning for zero-day detection
✓ Trade-offs between false positives and false negatives

Key takeaway: Anomaly detection finds unusual patterns, but requires human
expertise to distinguish malicious from merely unusual. It's one layer in
defense-in-depth security.

## Video 6: Time Series Forecasting - Energy Consumption
**Duration**: 5-6 minutes
**Notebook**: `time-series/energy_consumption_forecasting.ipynb`

### Script Outline

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
Final video in the series - Time Series Forecasting for energy consumption prediction.

This is the most complex ML task because time matters - we're predicting the FUTURE
based on the PAST. Data order is CRITICAL.
```

**[0:30-1:30] The Critical Difference - Time Series**
```
[Screen: Show comparison table]

Time Series vs Regular ML:

Regular ML:
❌ Can shuffle data randomly
❌ K-fold cross-validation
✓ Features are independent

Time Series:
✓ MUST preserve temporal order
✓ Walk-forward validation only
✓ Features are autocorrelated (past affects future)

[Screen: Show train-test split visualization]

THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: Never shuffle!

Wrong ❌: Random 80/20 split
- Leaks future information into training
- Unrealistically high accuracy
- Fails in production

Right ✓: Temporal split
- Train: 2022-01-01 to 2023-07-01
- Test: 2023-07-02 to 2023-12-31
- Simulates real forecasting scenario
```

**[1:30-2:30] Understanding the Data**
```
[Screen: Show time series plot]

2 years of daily energy consumption data (730 days)

Visual inspection reveals:
1. **Trend**: Upward - consumption increasing over time
2. **Seasonality**: Annual peaks (summer AC, winter heating)
3. **Weekly cycles**: Lower on weekends
4. **Random noise**: Day-to-day fluctuations

[Screen: Show decomposition plot]

Time series decomposition separates these components:
- Trend: +20 MW increase over 2 years (growth)
- Seasonal: ±15 MW swing (weather-driven)
- Residual: ±3 MW noise (unpredictable)

Understanding components guides model selection.
```

**[2:30-3:30] Baseline vs Statistical vs ML**
```
[Screen: Show model comparison results]

I tested 3 approaches:

**1. Naive Baseline** (Always start here!)
Tomorrow = Today
- MAE: 9.2 MW
- RMSE: 11.5 MW
- MAPE: 8.7%

Simple but surprisingly good! Any ML model MUST beat this.

**2. ARIMA (Statistical Model)**
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
- Pros: Interpretable, handles trends
- Cons: Assumes linear relationships
- MAE: 6.1 MW (34% improvement!)

**3. Random Forest (ML with Features)**
- MAE: 2.8 MW (70% improvement! 🎯)
- RMSE: 3.5 MW
- MAPE: 2.6%

Winner: Random Forest with feature engineering
```

**[3:30-4:30] The Magic: Feature Engineering**
```
[Screen: Show feature engineering code]

ML models need features. I created:

**Lag Features** (Use past values):
- lag_1: Yesterday's consumption (35% importance!)
- lag_7: Same day last week (12%)
- lag_30: Same day last month (8%)

**Rolling Statistics** (Capture trends):
- rolling_mean_7: 7-day moving average (22%)
- rolling_std_7: 7-day volatility (5%)

**Time Features** (Capture seasonality):
- day_of_week: Monday=1, Sunday=7 (15%)
- month: January=1, December=12
- is_weekend: Binary flag (6%)

**Cyclical Encoding**:
- day_sin, day_cos: Circular representation (Monday is "near" Sunday)

[Screen: Show feature importance plot]

This transforms time series into supervised learning:
Past consumption + Calendar info → Predict tomorrow
```

**[4:30-5:30] Forecasting Performance**
```
[Screen: Show forecast vs actual plot]

Look at these predictions!
- Blue line: Actual consumption
- Purple line: Random Forest forecast

The model captures:
✓ Weekly patterns (dips on weekends)
✓ Gradual upward trend
✓ Seasonal variations

[Screen: Show specific date examples]

Example predictions:
- Monday, Aug 7: Predicted 115.2 MW, Actual 114.8 MW (0.3% error)
- Saturday, Aug 12: Predicted 108.5 MW, Actual 109.1 MW (0.6% error)
- Wednesday, Sep 20: Predicted 117.8 MW, Actual 116.9 MW (0.8% error)

Average error: 2.6% - Excellent for energy planning!
```

**[5:30-6:00] Business Value & Conclusion**
```
Why this matters for energy companies:

1. **Grid Management**
   - Balance supply and demand in real-time
   - Prevent blackouts

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Buy electricity when prices are low
   - Reduce operating costs by millions

3. **Renewable Integration**
   - Plan for solar/wind variability
   - Schedule backup generators

4. **Customer Service**
   - Proactive maintenance during high demand
   - Avoid service disruptions

This project demonstrates:
✓ Proper time series handling (temporal splits!)
✓ Feature engineering from time data
✓ Model comparison (baseline → statistical → ML)
✓ 70% improvement over naive forecast
✓ Production-ready forecasting pipeline

Time series is challenging but incredibly valuable!

Thanks for watching the entire series! 🎉
