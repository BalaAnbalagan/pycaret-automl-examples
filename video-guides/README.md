## 🎯 Recording Tips

### Before Recording
1. Read the full guide once
2. Open the notebook in one window
3. Have the guide visible in another window
4. Do a dry run (just talk through, don't record)
5. When ready, hit record!

### During Recording
- Follow the timestamps loosely (not strictly)
- Use natural language (don't read like a script)
- Point to things on screen
- Show enthusiasm!
- Pause between sections (easier to edit)

### After Recording
- Save immediately
- Watch once to check quality
- Note any major mistakes
- Move to editing phase
