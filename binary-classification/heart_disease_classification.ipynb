This cell ensures compatibility by installing packages in the correct order to avoid runtime crashes.\n\n### Technical Details\n- Detect if running in Google Colab\n- Install compatible versions of base packages (numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn)\n- Install PyCaret without forcing full dependency resolution\n- Avoid version conflicts that cause runtime crashes\n\n### Expected Output\nInstallation progress messages and a reminder to restart the runtime. After restart, the notebook will work smoothly without dependency errors.\n\n### IMPORTANT\n⚠️ After running this cell, you MUST restart the runtime:\n- Click: **Runtime → Restart runtime** (or Ctrl+M .)\n- After restart, skip this cell and run all other cells normally"
