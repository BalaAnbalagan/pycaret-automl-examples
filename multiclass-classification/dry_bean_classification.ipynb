Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9+\n2. Activate the virtual environment\n3. Install PyCaret with specific compatible versions\n\n**For Google Colab**: Skip this cell (Colab manages its own environment)\n\n### Instructions\n\nThe virtual environment has already been created at the project root. Simply:\n\n1. **Select the kernel** in VS Code/Jupyter: `Python 3.9 (pycaret-venv)`\n2. **Run the next cell** to install packages\n\nIf you need to recreate the environment:\n```bash\ncd /Users/banbalagan/Projects/pycaret-automl-examples\nsource venv/bin/activate  # Use the existing venv\n```\n\n### Expected Output\nAfter selecting the kernel, you should see the environment path in the Python version indicator."

For local environments, we install specific package versions to ensure stability and reproducibility.\n\n### Technical Details\n- **Google Colab**: Install compatible versions to avoid runtime crashes\n- **Local Environment**: Install PyCaret with specific versions (Option 2 - recommended)\n- Import all necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning\n\n### Expected Output\n- **Google Colab**: Installation messages and a reminder to restart the runtime\n- **Local Environment**: Clean installation of all required packages\n\n### IMPORTANT (Google Colab Users)\n‚ö†Ô∏è After running this cell in Colab, you MUST restart the runtime:\n- Click: **Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime** (or Ctrl+M .)\n- After restart, skip this cell and run all other cells normally"

    "### Real-World Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Acquisition**:\n",
    "   - High-resolution cameras\n",
    "   - Consistent lighting conditions\n",
    "   - Conveyor belt speed vs. capture rate\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Image processing pipeline\n",
    "   - Quality of measurements\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Classification System**:\n",
    "   - Real-time prediction latency\n",
    "   - Confidence thresholds for routing\n",
    "   - Manual inspection queue for low-confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quality Assurance**:\n",
    "   - Regular model validation\n",
    "   - Track accuracy over time\n",
    "   - Update model with new data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Current Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Relies on quality image acquisition\n",
    "   - Performance depends on consistent measurement conditions\n",
    "   - Some variety pairs may remain difficult to distinguish\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Future Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Add color features (currently only shape/size)\n",
    "   - Include texture information\n",
    "   - Train on beans from different growing regions\n",
    "   - Implement active learning for edge cases\n",
    "   - Develop variety-specific sub-models for confused pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extended Applications**:\n",
    "   - Other legume crops (lentils, chickpeas, peas)\n",
    "   - Grain classification (rice, wheat varieties)\n",
    "   - Defect detection (damaged/healthy beans)\n",
    "   - Origin authentication\n",

    "### Comparison: Binary vs Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Binary (Heart Disease) | Multiclass (Dry Beans) |\n",
    "|--------|----------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| Classes | 2 (Yes/No) | 7 (Bean Varieties) |\n",
    "| Complexity | Simpler decision boundary | Complex boundaries between 7 classes |\n",
    "| Metrics | AUC, Accuracy | Macro/Weighted averages |\n",
    "| Confusion Matrix | 2x2 | 7x7 |\n",
    "| Evaluation | Focus on sensitivity/specificity | Per-class analysis important |\n",
    "| Deployment | Medical decision support | Automated sorting system |\n",
