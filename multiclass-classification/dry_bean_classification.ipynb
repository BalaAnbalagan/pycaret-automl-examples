    "# Multiclass Classification: Dry Bean Classification using PyCaret\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BalaAnbalagan/pycaret-automl-examples/blob/main/multiclass-classification/dry_bean_classification.ipynb)\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Dry beans are one of the most important legume crops worldwide with high genetic diversity. Proper classification of bean varieties is crucial for both agricultural production and market operations. Manual classification is time-consuming and requires expertise. In this notebook, we'll build a multiclass classification model to automatically classify dry beans into 7 different varieties based on their morphological features.\n",
