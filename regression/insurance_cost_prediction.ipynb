    "\n",
    "### What\n",
    "We're creating a dedicated virtual environment for this project to isolate dependencies and ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "Using a virtual environment is a best practice because:\n",
    "- Isolates project dependencies from system Python\n",
    "- Prevents version conflicts with other projects\n",
    "- Makes the project portable and reproducible\n",
    "- Allows specific package versions without affecting other projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details\n",
    "**For Local Development**:\n",
    "1. Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9+\n",
    "2. Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "3. Install PyCaret with specific compatible versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Google Colab**: Skip this cell (Colab manages its own environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Using venv (recommended)**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "cd /Users/banbalagan/Projects/pycaret-automl-examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create virtual environment\n",
    "python3.9 -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate virtual environment\n",
    "# On macOS/Linux:\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "# On Windows:\n",
    "# venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify Python version\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continue to next cell for package installation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Using conda**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create conda environment\n",
    "conda create -n pycaret-env python=3.9 -y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate environment\n",
    "conda activate pycaret-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "After activation, your terminal prompt should show `(venv)` or `(pycaret-env)` prefix, indicating the virtual environment is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "- Run this in your terminal BEFORE opening Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- After creating/activating the virtual environment, install Jupyter in it:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install jupyter notebook\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Then launch Jupyter from within the activated environment:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  jupyter notebook\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Select the kernel that corresponds to your virtual environment in Jupyter"

    "- Identify data types (numerical vs categorical)\n",

    "- Understand value ranges and distributions\n",
    "- Spot potential outliers\n",

    "Key observations to look for:\n",
    "- `charges` (target): Wide range from ~$1k to ~$60k\n",
    "- `age`: 18-64 years\n",
    "- `bmi`: Body Mass Index typically 15-55\n",

    "- `smoker`: Binary yes/no (major cost driver)\n",

    "We'll examine:\n",

    "- **Interactions**: Do effects combine? (e.g., old smoker vs young smoker)\n",

    "### Key Insights from Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smoking is the Dominant Factor**:\n",
    "   - Smokers pay 2-3x more than non-smokers\n",
    "   - Strongest predictor of insurance costs\n",
    "   - Clear incentive for smoking cessation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Age Effect is Significant**:\n",
    "   - Costs increase steadily with age\n",
    "   - Non-linear relationship\n",
    "   - Acceleration after 50\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BMI Shows Moderate Impact**:\n",
    "   - Higher BMI = higher costs\n",
    "   - More pronounced for smokers\n",
    "   - Obesity increases risk\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regional Variation Exists**:\n",
    "   - Some regions costlier than others\n",
    "   - Reflects healthcare cost differences\n",
    "   - Important for pricing strategy\n",

    "   - Regular retraining with new data\n",
    "   - Monitor prediction accuracy\n",
    "   - Track actual vs predicted costs\n",
    "   - Update for healthcare cost inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration**:\n",
    "   - API for quote requests\n",
    "   - Real-time predictions (<100ms)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Current Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Limited to 6 features (many factors affect costs)\n",
    "   - No medical history details\n",
    "   - No pre-existing conditions\n",
    "   - Simplified model of complex reality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Potential Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Add medical history variables\n",
    "   - Include prescription drug costs\n",
    "   - Account for family medical history\n",
    "   - Regional healthcare provider costs\n",
    "   - Lifestyle factors (exercise, diet)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Techniques**:\n",
    "   - Neural networks for complex interactions\n",
    "   - Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification\n",
